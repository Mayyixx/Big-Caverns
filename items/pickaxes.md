# PÃ¯ckaxes

Pickaxes are the only important tool of Big Caverns.

Each pickaxe has a proper mining power that allows it to break certain ores.

**Every pickaxe with a mining power greater than 5 gotta be created in Knight's Shaft, at the exception of the Food's Pick, as it's the Staff Pickaxe.**

The Food's Pickaxe has for ability the Food's Blessing , that grants Haste 10, Speed 3, Night Vision, Jump Boost 3, Absorption, Fire Resistance, Resistance, Regeneration ant thats it. It cant be normally obtained, only with the command /foodpick. Only three players are able to use it: XxBlazeBerryxX, YouLeGamer et firefood. It has a mining power of 10, the highest Mining Power yet never required, proving it's a staff pickaxe.
