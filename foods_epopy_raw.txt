FOOD'S EPOPY

Prologue

I do not think any of you
Of this story has got a clue;
It may seem false, also crazy
Maybe it's true, no one to see!
If of miners tales you're readers
Or of adventures great lookers,
Then this story is made for you;
But if reading you don't want to
Then let it be! And in my grave,
Let me bring all my miners, brave!


### Chapter XII
The rebellion ends

The sun had reached his highest place,
But in the cave no one could sense;
The fire bursts; the anger rises
Along with that the sun arises
And with the sun arises hope
To get more rights, but they said "Nope"
In this context did Food wake up
His head aching, coffee in cup
He drank it, trying to guess out
Why the anger? He had some doubts
The rebels were lining outside
Food, though, did follow them aside
Walking slowly trying to find
Where were his friends? They would be kind
To yell at him. But would it hear?
Workers were too many; who here
Would guess where Food was half hiding?
No one can find, I am bidding!
Thought Food while walking through the crowd
All miners were shouting aloud.
At last, he managed of finding
Where good Karim was here screaming
Along with others; when Food'd seen
Him, he did say, 'Where have you been?'
'I was seeking for you, my friend'
Answered Karim, reaching the end
Of the small cave where all of them
A little pause were having some.
And then, behold, attacking with surprise
Of the Lazy Miner's allies;
They don't have swords, they have pickaxes
Not that useful! Some come with axes!
The crowd yelling, but now of fear
Now to them it was crystal clear:
The Lazy Miner was angry
The crowd leader: 'They come for me!'
Well, he was right! At that moment
They ran at him, with a lament
No one heard him ever again
Of his body, the head remained...
All the others, staring at this
Began to run: that was abyss!
Meanwhile, Food stood here with Karim
The enemies were launching steam
And, all of a sudden, all stopped
All went to work, their pickaxes dropped!
That same day went both Food and You
To Lazy Miner, askin' their due!
They said 'Hello', he greeted them;
Well he knew that they weren't with 'em
That half-rebelled against his rules.
'What do you want? You ain't those fools
Who made me kill this poor miner.'
They looked each other; Food said, 'Sir,
We'd want you to allow us to
Go to Knights' Shaft, of that told you
It is a good place, isn't it?'
He said: 'Permission? I grant it!
You're only both who remain good
May you get all you need, you should!
However, dudes, listen to me:
There the ruler, it isn't me;
They speak weirdly, you'll get used to.
Now go, have fun, and both of you!'
Food and You didn't wait to go:
In front the door, none of them knows
What there awaits them; here they go!
Taken by darkness, they go low...


Chapter XIII
Welcome to Knight's Shaft!

When out the dark they came to light
All was glowy, all was so bright;
The colors of all the ores here
Made them blind, like drunk by some beer.
They came out the arcade and so
A man was here, holding a bow;
He had a kind of good armor,
Not of i'on made, its price was more:
The ore was blue, legendary,
An ore all knew, no one did see;
Its name, all knew, it is mithril
For that, all humans would have killed.
The knight in armor talked to them:
'Greetings, dear friends, where are ye from?'
He talked in a strange way, for sure
Maybe for this there was a cure;
H'wever, Food brave, talked to he:
'Who are you, mate, fall from a tree?'
The man in front, a good soldier
Did understand so much anger:
He took Food's speech for an insult
Bow to shoulder was the result;
You however understood well
That the soldier, what Food had tell,
Took it for slang. And, politely,
He answered very calmly:
'We beg thy pardon, our good friend;
We're not from here, this step's our end:
We seek for things that may tell us
Where the good fate here hath brought us;
Pardon my friend! He asked thee
If thou hast ever fell from tree.'
The soldier's face then had a smile
What in his head could have pass by!
What a polite man he was, You
That they were old, that well he knew.
So the soldier placed bow on floor
And behind them closed the big door
'My name's Harry, but what is thine?'
'You's it'; answered he, while on spine
Shivers were making him trembling.
'If you're new here, then may I bring
You to the place where is our King;
His name's Arthur, the righteous King
Of Knight's Shaft he's; a so good being!'
Food did not understand a thing...
The soldier left them here, for true:
You said they could find it, although
They were new here, and he knew it.
They began to walk on some bits
Of stone that were cut off in squares
To make paths, where were men with spears.
You's confident: what could go wrong?
He thought of that walking along.
Food looked around, his eyes streaming
Of all colors he was seeing;
Blue, green, orange, gray everywhere
Ores he never saw anywhere;
'Blue's mithril', said You while walking
Towards the palace of the King
'I've seen how you spoke to that guard,
I didn't catch a word of that'
'It's easy, hey!' said You happy
To learn to Food a thing quickly:
'You only need to replace you
by thou, thee, thy, thine, 't' to put
You'll speak like me, for sure, I swear!'
They passed near two men with two spears.
They didn't see it while talking:
They had ent'red Palace of King!
The trumpets rang, like an anthem
A mighty man looking at them;
He wore a long red cape for him
For it shoulders made it had been
His wonderful crown of pure gold
With pure jewels all to behold
He had a great smile on his face:
It's like he waited them for ages.
Food quickly understood the point:
King Arthur! They reached their endpoint.



Chapter XXXII
Food the Miner am I

That day the Knight's Shaft was boiling:
Food a big speech was then making;
In front of the King he would say
How much he thanks him, stuff, but hey
All long that day, in all the streets
Any here comes to any, greets,
And shout together; ''live the King!'
'Long live Food!' and Food was dreading;
Eventually, the hour had rang
To the palace everyone ranks;
Food's not alone; You is with him
As well as Bibow and Karim
The noise now drops, the silence sets
Kneeling to King, nearer he gets
And Food then begins all those words
He feels the looking of the hordes...
'Food the Miner am I, faithful,
To my homeland's eternal blood;
To homeland shall I be trustful
Until death decides me to fool;
A Knight of King Arthur am I,
For him, loyal and fearless I'm,
And shall remain; And King Arthur
Never shall I betray, for sure.
My shield and hope art Thou, O King;
Thou hast helped me when I'd needing
To Thee I make a final gain:
Please never leave me'alone again
That I'd remain forevermore
Thy most faithful knight anymore
And that the dark parts that I have
Never ever to Thee behave.'
The crowd exults, people applause;
'Needing' torments him, then a pause.
'Long live the King!' and 'Long live Food!'
Food then stands up; that wasn't good!

Big bad dwarf curses a ring (Book V)

Am I now free? Like, really free?	
Then towards you is, yes, for free	
My freedom's first greeting; listen	
You thieve, what you're getting, listen!	
Since by a curse it's been coming,	
Then forever be cursed this Ring!	
Since it made me fully mighty,		
Then may it bring the death to he	
That's wearing it; of it, no one	
Will get pleasure. He that has one	
Will fear a betray, a rob'ry,		
He that hasn't shall feel envy		
That he would even kill to have		
This dear robb'd Ring I used to have!	
He that has it will then renounce	
To his owning the slightest ounce!	
The Ring will get any cov'ring,		
He'll live only for his gold ring		
It shall make burn any of them		
That are full of the ev'ry gems!		
Useful for none, every want it!		
But only one will get this bit		
Of gold that stole ago the dwarf;	
It will kill him, like the death scarf!	
Ever fatal to its owner			
That won't ever be a loaner;		
It shall lead him to his cutthroats	
And of this here I make the oath!	
It shall the coward paralyze		
Nowhere ever he'll find allies;		
It will make of the life a death		
Oddly harmful will be to breathe!	
Oh, the Ring's lord? More the ring's slave! 
The wage for what I didn't gave!	
Until this day, this blissful day		
Where the Ring won't be of me away!
Then keep it, King, keep then my Ring!	
My curse Thou shalt not be flying!
