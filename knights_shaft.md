# Knight's Shaft

The Knight's Shaft: without any doubt the biggest, greatest and most important place of the whole Big Caverns, containing the most ores, quests, NPCs, lore, sub-areas...

## Location, progression, description

The Knight's Shaft is the 4th out of 6 areas in the Big Caverns and contains a large number of areas (didn't want to count ngl). It is meant to be accessed when the player reaches Level 55. It is a giant cave, with many sub-areas as said before, each containing one or several different ores.

The Knight's Shaft is also, economically speaking, a very important place: it contains the Mystery Box, the Soldiers' Dwelling (managed by Miklos), the Bank, the Forge, the biggest shop, and it's also the only area where you can up your HotM Tier with Gemstones even though Knight's Shaft contains many quests and NPCs.

## Quests

### The Apprentice's Puzzles
Luke asks puzzles to the player who gotta find the answer button in the Knight's Shaft. Each puzzle has a picarats level. At each bad answer, the player loses 10 picarats. At the end, the number of picarats remaining * 100 = the HotM EXP gotten by the quest.

**tldr**: 3000000h to find rdm buttons and anwser stupid puzzles.

### Olaf's Request
Olaf asks the player to find steles. Thats it. No reward, no quest number, just finding stupid steles.

* **Miklos** gets his name from the real Hungarian admiral Horthy Miklos, king of Hungary between WW1 and WW2 as well as most of WW2.
* **Olaf** gets his name from the Historian Zora in *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild* (or at least i think olaf is his name)

## Addendum 1: The Weird Way of Speaking (aka Shakespearean English)

| Pronoun | French Equivalent | Modern Equivalent | Hungarian Equivalent | Note |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| thou | tu | you (singular) | te |
| thee | toi, te | you (singular, complement) | téged |
| thy | ton, ta, tes | your (singular) | a te |
| thine | ton, ta, tes | your (singular), yours | a te | Only "your" if the word after begins with a vowel. *thine eyes* |
| thyself | toi-même | yourself (singular) | magad |
| ye | vous (pluriel) | you (plural) | te | All the derivatives of ye are the same as in modern english. (your, yourself...)|
| mine | mon, ma, mes | my, mine | az enyém | As for "thine", only replaces my if the word begins with a vowel. *mine eyes* |

**Exceptions are highlightened.**

| Pronoun | Conjugation | Examples | English Translation |
|-|-|-|-|
| thou | -t, -est | thou shalt, thou willst, thou wantest, thou tellest, **thou art**, **thou hast**, **thou doest**, **thou canst** | you shall, you will, you want, you tell, you are, you have, you do, you can | 
| he, she, it | -th instead of -s | **he shall** he willeth, he wanteth, he telleth, **he is**, he hath, he doth, **he can** |
| **it is** | 'tis | 'Tis this I wanted to talk thee about. | It's this I wanted to talk you about. |

**Other important things:**
* The future auxiliary is rarely *will*, instead use *shall*.
  
**Note pour Food**: le français "oyé oyé braves gens" vient en fait de l'anglais "o ye", toujours utilisé par les crieurs pour les déclarations royales tah le couronnement.
