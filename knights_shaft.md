# Knight's Shaft

The Knight's Shaft: without any doubt the biggest, greatest and most important place of the whole Big Caverns, containing the most ores, quests, NPCs, lore, sub-areas...

## Location, progression, description

The Knight's Shaft is the 4th out of 6 areas in the Big Caverns and contains a large number of areas (didn't want to count ngl). It is meant to be accessed when the player reaches Level 55. It is a giant cave, with many sub-areas as said before, each containing one or several different ores.

The Knight's Shaft is also, economically speaking, a very important place: it contains the Mystery Box, the Soldiers' Dwelling (managed by Miklos), the Bank, the Forge, the biggest shop, and it's also the only area where you can up your HotM Tier with Gemstones even though Knight's Shaft contains many quests and NPCs.
