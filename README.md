# The Big Caverns

The Big Caverns is a Housing, on the Minecraft server named Hypixel, created by firefood and YouLeGamer.
It is meant to be a mining simulator yet has a lore which makes it a kind of a RPG.

The project has begun in 2022 yet the version 2 of the project has begun on June 17th 2023.

In this repository, the Big Caverns as a project will be named as project Lodibidon.

Of course big thanks to XxBlazeBerryxX :D

The housing code in this project will be under the ".ho" for HOusing.

*I tried .hs for HouSing, but thats Haskell, and I also tried .hh for Hypixel Housing but APPARENTLY ITS C++*
