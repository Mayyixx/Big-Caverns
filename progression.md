## Levels

  The following table describes the four main ways of increasing the xpmax, the fourth one being irregular
  
*Note: x = xpmax, y = level, z = new xpmax, a = xpmax coefficient*

| Formula | Description | Notes | Effect / Problem | Reset ? |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| z = x * 2 | The xpmax is multiplied by 2 per level. | This formula is used in Placeholder. | Too much xp to farm | No |
| z = x + 5 | Adds 5 to the xpmax per level. | This formula was used by Big Caverns v1 | Not enough xp to farm | Yes |
| z = x + (x - y) / 2 | The xpmax is doubled and adds the half of xpmax - level | This formula was used by Big Caverns v2 at the beginning. | Too hard to calculate + too much xp to farm | Yes |
| z = x + a | Adds the xpmax coefficient to the xpmax per level | This formula is the one currently used in Big Caverns v2. | Perfect | Yes |

Note that the second formula is the same than the fourth one, but with a regular coefficient which is 5.

Here is the table of the xpmax coefficient for the fourth formula, changing when you first discover a new area.

| Area | Xpmax Coefficient |
|-|-|
| Upper Mines | 10 |
| Medium Caves | 20 |
| Lower Mines | 30 |
| Knight's Shaft | 500 |
| Deep Den | 10000 |
| Hell Quarry | 11000 |
